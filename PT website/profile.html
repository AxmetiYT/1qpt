 The community is all about taking good care of their beloved children that they have helped and support. This community is focusing on helping those children that are abandoned by their family.
<br> <br>
The usual concerns/problems that this type of community might have are their donations/the things that the organization/institution needed, especially during the pandemic that they should have a lot of food supplies for their daily needs. 
 <br> <br>
 The commonalities and differences of this community to our/my community is that, first the difference/s between my community and this community is that we have a lot of supplies/things that the people needed the most right now. While this community needs a lot of supplies for their children and for the people that work in that community. Now the commonalities of our community and this community is that   
 <br> <br>
 The important information that I needed to know about this community is that if this community is excellent, and is its location good enough for the children and them? Do they need anything? Does this institution have many people who donate something for the children and for the people who worked there? 
 <br> <br>
 As an Atenean, it is essential to raise awareness in this type of community, because at this time right now. A lot of people, organizations and, etc. are struggling to survive. This community should be focused right now, and the only thing to help them is to make a website/webpage about our partner institution. Wherein we will post this in social media since a lot of people right now are using social media for them to work, school, etc. Soon, if we could raise awareness in this type of community, then a lot of people could be informed about this, and they could help us support the needs of this community. Since the Ateneans, care for others, and we would always find a way to make others happy and safe. We want what’s best for others, not just for ourselves.
