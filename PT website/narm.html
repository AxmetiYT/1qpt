<h2>Needs
</h2>

<div id = "info">

<h3>The needs that they have are their basic needs, Academic Performance, and the Behavioral developments of their children. Their basic needs benefactors and donations are decreasing and the donations they received because of this pandemic. The donations that they received are decreasing, but they still receive but maybe just a few, and because of this, they have problems with the learning of the children there, etc. The Academic Performance of the children - such as reading comprehension - needs to improve. The Behavioral development of children is also another challenge among the staff.</h3><br>
 <br>
  <br>
  <h3>The things that we can acquire that can be used to meet these needs is that we can encourage other people to at least give a little amount and of money and donate there old books that they are not using and we as well are going to do the same thing. This task of creating a web page could also help us get the attention of other people that they could also help in our partner institution. Even if it is just through social media, it would still be a big help for our partner institution and us. I say that because of these simple acts of support can help them a lot and so that they will somehow have a solution to there problems and needs. </h3><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
<h3>To put together these resources to meet these unmet needs most effectively by donating and help them sustain their organization/institution. Also, in this way, we could help our partner institution. A good service that we could offer is to make a webpage/website so that we could continue supporting their needs/the needs of the institution. Because with this, we would always be updated on their needs and, etc.  It could be significant because many people can visit this site and also can help the organization/institution with their problems/needs.</h3> <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<h3> To make our proposal sustainable and not just temporary, we must make our website posted online, so that we could be able to be still updated of our partner institution. Also, we can continue helping them. We want to continue supporting our institution even if we will say goodbye to our partner institution. Because in this way, we could learn a lot from them. It would also make our youth years be a wonderful one because even if we’re facing a pandemic right now, we can still help our partner institution. Because with the help of the webpage/website that we are making right now, it could benefit them since if many people can view our work/s, then there would be a possibility that many people can donate and also help them.</h3> <br>
