<h3> Padre Pio's home for Children helped a lot of children right now, but our partner institution is having some issues/ <br>
challenges that are facing right now. We can't go out right now because of the pandemic, the only way that we could help <br>
our institution is through social media. Wherein, we could create a website for our institution, and the pieces of <br>
information that will be needed by the people that can see our webpage would be informed. With this, they could help us<br> 
in supporting our partner institution; also, we could improve our institution in solving their issues/ challenges that <br>
they are facing right now.<br>

<h3>Padre Pio`s Home for Children stems from the “Sisters, Apostles of Jesus Crucified.” The Sisters is a religious Institute <br>
founded by father Domenico Labellarte, an Italian priest who was a spiritual son of St. Padre Pio for 26 years. <br>
Providentially, the Institute founded a mission house here in the Philippines through the invitation of Msgr. Josefino<br>
 Ramirez who was the parish priest of San Lorenzo Ruiz Parish, Binondo Metro Manila.<br>

 <h3> Initially, the Sisters who were assigned here in the Philippine mission were dedicating themselves to work for the poor in<br>
 Binondo, however, as time goes by, they transferred to Mindanao – at Rambutan St. Tugbok, Davao City since someone <br>
 offered to donate a parcel of land where they could establish their mission home - the Padre Pio's Home for Children.<br>
